A lightweight, reusable Android library that simplifies runtime permission management across API levels 26â€“35. This library processes permission requests sequentially and delivers results via a callback interface, making it easy to integrate permission handling in any Android project.

Key Features:

Sequential Permission Requests:
Processes permissions one-by-one to avoid overlapping dialogs.

API-Level Handling:
Supports deprecated permissions (e.g. legacy storage) and conditional requests (e.g. POST_NOTIFICATIONS on Android 13+).

Battery Optimization Handling:
Special handling for permissions like REQUEST_IGNORE_BATTERY_OPTIMIZATIONS.

Callback Interface:
Uses a simple interface to decouple permission logic from your UI, allowing customized handling of each permission result.

Easy Integration:
Designed as a library module (or AAR) that can be added to any Android project.

Get started by integrating the library in your project and implementing the provided PermissionResultListener in your host Activity to handle permission results effortlessly.
